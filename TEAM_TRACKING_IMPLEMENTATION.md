# Team Tracking Implementation - Voter Data Collection System

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive tracking to distinguish between public form submissions and team member form submissions, allowing the system to track who filled what forms and provide detailed analytics.

## Key Features Implemented

  - `form_source` - Whether form was filled publicly ('public') or by team ('team')
  - `filled_for_self` - Whether the form was filled for the team member themselves

- **New Indexes Added:**
  - `idx_submissions_filled_by_user_id` - For efficient querying by team member
  - `idx_submissions_form_source` - For filtering by form source
  - `idx_submissions_filled_for_self` - For tracking self-registrations

### 2. API Routes

## Data Flow

### Public Form Submission
1. User fills form on `/student` page
2. Form submits to `/api/submit-form`
3. Submission marked as `form_source: 'public'`, `filled_for_self: true`
4. WhatsApp notification sent to voter's mobile

### Team Form Submission
1. Team member logs in to `/team` page
2. Clicks "Add Student" button
3. Form submits to `/api/team/submit-form` with JWT authentication
4. Submission marked as `form_source: 'team'` with team member details
5. WhatsApp notification sent to voter's mobile

## Analytics and Reporting

### Team Dashboard Analytics
- **Total Submissions**: All submissions count
- **Public Registrations**: Self-registered by citizens
- **Team Registrations**: Filled by team members
- **Your Team's Work**: Personal count for logged-in team member

### Database Queries
- Filter by form source (public/team)
- Filter by team member who filled the form
- Track team member performance
- Generate reports by district/taluka with team attribution

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Team forms require JWT authentication
- Public forms remain open (no authentication)

### Rate Limiting
- Applied to both public and team form submissions
- Prevents abuse while allowing legitimate high-volume usage

### Data Validation
- Same validation rules for both form types
- File upload security maintained
- Input sanitization preserved

## Usage Instructions
